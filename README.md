# Digital-Thermometer-Desig
This is a digital thermometer designed using simple arduino Uno . I had the pleasure of presenting this project in a webinar organized with fellow colleagues from a Space and Aeronautics Student team I am a member of, that has its headquartes in the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

First file is the image of the entire project showing all the connections and electronics used.
Second file is the code developed for this simple, yet usefull implementation. 

This project is better explained(In Greek) and presented by me in the webinar organized with my colleagues, along with other projects as well in this link:

A.S.A.T. (Aristotle Space and Aeronautics Team) was founded in November 2015. Our team is the largest technical team of AUTh, the Balkan university with the biggest student community. We are currently focused on 2 technical projects - Aeronautics and Rocketry.
